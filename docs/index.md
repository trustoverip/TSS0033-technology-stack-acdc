# Authentic Chained Data Containers

## Abstract

Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC) Standard Specification provides semantic of authentic provenance chaining of authentic data containers. This semantics include both source provenance and authorization provenance or delegation.

## Motivation

We need a way to chain authentic data together, allowing its provenance to be traced. This is valuable in many use cases:

* Supply chain, where a valid transfer of custody downstream depends on the validity of all upstream handoffs.
* Delegation, where a delegate's privileges derive from a chain of authorizations that must extend back to a source that is empowered.
* Citation of sources (in art, in journalism, in academia, or in credential issuance), where an author wants to clarify that a particular assertion originates elsewhere. This allows the assertion to acquire (or lose) gravitas independent of the reputation of the author who includes it. It also allows analysis of license compliance.

The last of these examples deserves special comment. There is a tension between the decentralization that we want in a verifiable credential ecosystem, and the way that trust tends to centralize because knowledge and reputation are unevenly distributed. We want anyone to be able to attest to anything they like--but we know that verifiers care very much about the reputation of the parties that make those attestations.

We could say that verifiers will choose which issuers they trust. This is exactly what most practioners of VCs recommend, and it works in early pilots. However, this places a heavy burden on verifiers, over the long haul--verifiers can't afford to vet every potential issuer of credentials they might encounter. The result will be a tendency to accept credentials only from a short list of issuers, which leads back to centralization.

This tendency also creates problems with delegation. If all delegation has to be validated through a few authorities, a lot of the flexibility and power of delegation is frustrated.

We'd like a landscape where a tiny startup can issue an employment credential with holder attributes taken as seriously as one from a massive global conglomerate--and with no special setup by verifiers to trust them equally. And we'd like parents to be able to delegate childcare decisions to a babysitter on the spur of the moment--and have the babysitter be able to prove it when she calls an ambulance.

## Scope

This document describes a mechanism whereby assertions about data can be provenanced in a provably authentic chain. Evaluating the integrity of the chain is in scope -- and because such chains leads to one or more root sources, the chain provides the raw material for making judgments about the data's utility or probable veracity. However, evaluating the data's utility or veracity is out of scope.

In other words, this standard concerns itself with proving that party C got its data in a valid way from party B, who in turn got it from party A. The degree to which the origin party, A, is trustworthy in their assertions about reality is not our concern.

## Terminology

- `SAID` - Self-Addressing Identifier - any identifier which is deterministaclly generated out of the content, digest of the content


## Specification



### Overview

An ACDC may be built up from an authentic data container (ADC) that contains an authentic provenance chain (APC). The term authentic data container (ADC) is an important abstract concept that hopefully may leverage a pre-existing open concrete
implementation standard specification. The current targeted concrete implementation specification is the W3C Verifiable Credential (VC) standard. We believe that authentic data containers (ADCs) with authentic provenance chains (APCs) that together compose an authentic chained data container (ACDC) are essential components of verifiable or authentic data supply chains which in turn are essential to what may be called the authentic data economy

### ACDC as Verifiable Labeled Property Graph Fragment
The structure of an ACDC may be modeled as a fragment of a Labeled Property Graph. The `p` block is an array of edges and the `a` block is the node. The remainder of the ACDC may be metadata about the node that may also be included as special node properties. Because, the edges in labeled property graphs may also have labeled properties, a more aligned representation would make each source entry a labeled block (or at least as an option). This is illustrated in the following example:

```

    {
       d: "did:1209u091u9012d/attestation/1234",  // SAID
       i: "did:1209u091u9012d",
       p: 
       [
            {sourcEdgeLabel: {i: "did:kdjflkeje", tid: "did:jd892j108jd1029", ...}}, // attestation id not in namespace of testator
            {anotherSourceEdgeLabel: {i: "did:9d9j109j1d902dj19/attestation/3242", ...}},  // attestation id in namespace of testator
            {yetAnotherSourceEdgeLabel: {i: "did:h78h8d2h8d2h8hd28d/attestation/1234",...}}  // attestation id in namespace of testator
        ],
        s: {}, || SAID
        a: 
        {
           i: "SAID",
           k: v,
           k1: SAID,  // ref1
         }, || SAID
         r: {}  || SAID
     }


```

Because each ACDC thus composed is verifiable, a verifiable graph may be communicated via verifiable graph fragments. Given any starting node or root node in the graph, one may add onto the graph by communicating graph fragments where each fragment includes a new node and the edge or edges that connect it to one or more pre-existing nodes.  The over-the-wire communication of the fragment is secured by the immutability of the ACDC contents (SAIDs) and the signature or committment proofs on the fragment.  This drives the structure of any given ACDC to be a graph fragment not a graph in and of itself.  The semantics of who issues or testates to a fragment and who the fragment is issued to (if any) may vary. With an issuer and isuee then the fragment may be an authorization or delegation. If the isuee is the node itself then the fragment is just provenanced data in a provenanced graph.

### Benefits

TODO:
- focus on generic problem of authentic data
- do not relay on any specific network nor implementation

ACDC focus on the base semantic specification to address core properties of authentic data flows. ACDC provides semantic allowing to express:
- authenticity for any data flow
- self-describing mechanism to understand the context of data
- chaining mechanism (including delegation)
- increasing interoperability by not relaying on any specific use case and implementation
